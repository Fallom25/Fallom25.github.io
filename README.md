# Weather Widget

## Project Description
This is a weather widget editor and display. It allows users to modify a weather widget using a form. This form data will then be used to create a weather widget of the user's current location.

## Asumptions
- Blue line is progress bar
- When you change the Temp to Fahrenheit you also want to change the wind speed to Miles/hour
- Temperature is to be rounded to whole number
- Wind Direction goes as precise as Two compass sections
- Wind Direction does not go past 360 Degrees
- All colors were picked using the example photo and *image color picker*

## How to Install and Run
I have chosen to use Npm and Node.js as my command line utility. 

**Installing**
- Cloning the repo
- Having Npm and Node.js install on your machine
- Running *npm install* in the command line 

**Run**
- Once npm install has finished running
- Using the *npm start* command will host the project locally

## How to use / Outline of my Solution


## Considerations and Further Growth
**Progress Bar issues**
**ESLint**
**Material UI**
**nvm**
**null checks**
**React final-form**
**Typescript**
**Context vs Redux**
**ConfigureStore vs CreateStore**
**createAsyncThunk**
**Cookie Geolocation**
**React-testing-library vs Enzyme**

## Personal Comments
I took me much longer than 3 hours. Although I managed to plan out a solution in quick a short amount of time, it took me longer than expected to build the components just using HTML/CSS as opposed to a component library. I did have fun fiddling around with some new Redux Toolkit functions I hadn't used before. When I first started to build it the overall concept seemed simple enough but the more I built the more small things were a little more sneaky and I hope I got all the little details right.
